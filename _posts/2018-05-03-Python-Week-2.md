I did not complete all of the work as my time during lunch was limited, however I did as much as I could which caught my up with the class well.</td>

    <td>To be honest being unable to attend the lesson due to illness limited my learning quite a lot as I fell behind the rest of my class in a subject i had only started a week previous, however I pulled it back as best as I could by attending the IT labs.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try my best to stay healthy enough to be in school and i will also try and become prepared for whenever I'm ill so i can ask my peers or teacher for the work that needs to be caught up on.</td>
