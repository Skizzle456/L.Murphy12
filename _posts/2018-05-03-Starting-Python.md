    <td>This week I learnt by getting my head down and working hard because I was starting a brand new topic in which I wanted to get the hang of early and concentrating the first time I start gives me the best chance of understanding python early and possibly getting ahead of my class.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week the prime reason for my learning to b3e limited was not understanding the task first time which made me go a lot slower and fall behind my class. However this was all turned round when I started concentrating and focussing on getting an understanding of python and catching up to my class.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will keep talking to a minimum and try my best to keep concentration the whole lesson and not fall behind again otherwise it will lead to consequences e.g having to do my work in a lunchtime instead of spending time with my friends or even possibly getting a detention so I should always keep my eyes on the work and try my hardest for next time.</td>
