    <td>I learnt by concentrating hard like last week and got through all the work I set myself out to do which was a big achievement. An effective strategy is to ask questions when unsure and also to persevere.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact I got distracted by my friends around me and so talking to them slowed down my work process. Habits I need to work on not getting distracted by the people around me </td>
