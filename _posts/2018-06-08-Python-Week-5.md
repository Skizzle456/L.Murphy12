    <td>This week I leant by concentrating hard and when the task such as the multiplication coding was hard for me however I overcame it and learnt where I went wrong and continued to work hard and get it right from there. An effective strategy was to ignore outside voices excluding the teacher so I could keep full concentration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by not fully concentrating as I broke what one of my strategies was as I talked to one of my peers beside my. This is a habit I need to work on because otherwise I won't get as much work done therefore I will not achieve my target.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and not get distracted by others so that I can focus on my work. By concentrating I will therefore improve my learning as I can and will be able to work more efficiently with nothing to distract me.  </td>
