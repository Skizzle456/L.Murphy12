    <td>This week I learnt by trial and error as some things weren't working when I tried them in codecademy however I got my head down and persevered when doing my work which gave me the spirit I needed. I also used simple strategies to help get through my work like reading the question very closely which was an effective strategy.</td>

    <td>This week my learning was limited due to the fact that I was not concentrating which lead my to not getting it right in codecademy. A main habit in which I will need to work on is getting distracted as it is common for that to happen to myself .</td>
