    <td>This week I learnt by not getting distracted easily as I sat in a different seat in which nobody sat around meet which forced me to get my head down and work. This meant that I could work without being distracted or having someone else distracting me which was a good strategy which helped me earn my tenth badge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week my learning was limited as I was not concentrating on my work as much and instead trying to work out how to upload my codecademy badges to my blog which frustrated me and stopped me from working more efficiently. A habit I will therefore need to work on is to not focus on work that isn't class work and to try and solve the problem at home.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will leave non class work for homework so I can focus on the class work and hopefully earn more badges in the lesson if Iâ€™m doing the proper work. This will improve my learning as it is a strategy to learn more and get more badges which enhances my knowledge </td>
