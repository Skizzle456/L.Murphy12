    <td>This week I leant by concentrating hard and when the task such as the multiplication coding was hard for me however I overcame it and learnt where I went wrong and continued to work hard and get it right from there. An effective strategy was to get my head down and work hard as I also had a very big homework at task.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by not fully concentrating as I broke what one of my strategies was as I talked to one of my peers beside my. This is a habit I need to work on because otherwise I won't get as much work done as I had a lot to do therefore I will not achieve my target.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will fully concentrate as I had a big task at hand in which I could have got it finished with better concentration. My learning will be improved if I listen to my peers and the advice they are giving me.</td>
